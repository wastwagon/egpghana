      "title": "Analyzing the President’s Five Pillars for Ghana’s Economic and Social Transformation",
      "slug": "analyzing-presidents-five-pillars",
      "excerpt": "An empirical assessment of the feasibility and impact of the new strategic framework for Ghana's transformation.",
      "content": "This assessment examines the President’s Five Pillars as a strategic framework for Ghana’s economic and social transformation as reported by the Daily Graphic, with the aim of evaluating their feasibility, coherence, and potential impact. It seeks to move beyond broad policy statements by grounding the pillars in empirical evidence, current economic realities, and institutional capacity.\n\nThe assessment draws on credible national and international data to analyze how each pillar aligns with Ghana’s development challenges, including fiscal constraints, unemployment, human capital gaps, governance weaknesses, environmental pressures, and social inclusion. It evaluates both the opportunities presented by the pillars and the structural bottlenecks that could limit effective implementation.\n\n1. A Productive and Diversified Economy\nGhana’s economic structure remains highly concentrated, making diversification an urgent necessity. According to the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), agriculture, industry, and services contributed 21.3%, 32.4%, and 46.3% to GDP respectively in 2024, yet exports remain dominated by gold, cocoa, and oil, which together account for over 80% of export earnings. Manufacturing contributes less than 11% of GDP, well below the levels observed in peer emerging economies.\nProductivity growth is also weak; the World Bank estimates Ghana’s labour productivity growth at below 1.5% annually over the past decade. This constrains job creation despite positive GDP growth. Achieving this pillar therefore requires scaling industrial value addition, lowering energy and credit costs, and expanding SME access to finance particularly long-term capital if diversification is to translate into resilience and employment.\n\n2. Human Capital Development\nHuman capital outcomes in Ghana reveal a strong access–quality gap. While Free SHS has raised secondary school enrolment by over 30% since 2017, learning outcomes remain weak. The World Bank’s Human Capital Index (2023) places Ghana at 0.44, meaning a child born today will be only 44% as productive as they could be with full education and health.\nUnemployment among youth (15–35 years) stands at over 19%, with underemployment significantly higher, reflecting persistent skills mismatch. In health, Ghana spends about 3.2% of GDP, below the Abuja target of 15% of government expenditure, contributing to NHIS arrears and health worker emigration. Without stronger investment in TVET, skills alignment, and health system financing, the human capital pillar risks yielding limited economic returns.\n\n3. Good Governance and National Discipline\nGovernance weaknesses have been a central driver of Ghana’s fiscal distress. Public debt rose from 55% of GDP in 2019 to over 90% in 2023, prompting IMF intervention. The IMF Governance Diagnostic Assessment (2024) highlights vulnerabilities in procurement, SOE oversight, and asset declaration enforcement.\nCorruption-related inefficiencies are estimated by Transparency International and UNDP to cost Ghana 2–3% of GDP annually, equivalent to several billion cedis in lost public resources. While institutions such as the Auditor-General and OSP exist, enforcement remains uneven. This pillar can only be realized if fiscal rules are respected beyond IMF conditionality, procurement transparency is strengthened, and accountability institutions are insulated from political influence.",

      "excerpt": "IMF Board completes fifth review, unlocking $385m disbursement as macroeconomic stabilization takes hold.",
      "content": "The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the fifth review of Ghana’s 39-month Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement, approving the immediate disbursement of about US$385 million (SDR 267.5 million). This brings total IMF disbursements to Ghana to approximately US$2.8 billion under the US$3 billion programme approved in May 2023.\n\nAccording to the IMF, Ghana’s performance under the programme has been broadly satisfactory, with all quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for the review met.The Fund noted that macroeconomic stabilisation is gaining momentum, supported by stronger- than - expected economic growth, improved fiscal and external balances, and progress on debt restructuring.Inflation has returned to single - digit levels for the first time since 2021, while foreign exchange reserves have exceeded programme targets, aided by strong gold and cocoa exports and renewed investor confidence.\n\nThe IMF acknowledged continued progress on public debt restructuring, with Ghana having signed bilateral agreements with several official creditors and reached Agreements in Principle with multiple commercial creditors.Fiscal discipline remains central to the programme, with Ghana on track to achieve a primary surplus of 1.5 % of GDP by end - 2025. The 2026 Budget, now before Parliament, aligns with programme objectives and the new fiscal responsibility framework, balancing consolidation with development and social protection priorities.\n\nThe Fund welcomed the Bank of Ghana’s cautious monetary easing, following declining inflation and recent appreciation of the cedi, while emphasizing that further easing should remain gradual and data - dependent.It also highlighted steps taken to safeguard financial stability, including reforms in state - owned banks, improved crisis management frameworks, and measures to reduce non - performing loans.\n\nDespite the positive outlook, the IMF stressed that sustained reform momentum is essential.Stronger domestic revenue mobilization, improved public financial management, better oversight of state - owned enterprises, and deeper governance and anti - corruption reforms remain critical to maintaining macroeconomic stability, restoring debt sustainability, and creating an environment conducive to private - sector - led growth and job creation.",

      "slug": "bog-350bps-rate-cut-implications",
      "excerpt": "The MPC's bold 350bps rate cut signals a turning point for Ghana’s recovery. What does this mean for businesses and households?",
      "content": "The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Ghana has concluded its 127th meeting with a significant decision — a reduction in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 350 basis points, from 21.5% to 18%. This is the largest single cut in the current easing cycle and marks a turning point in Ghana’s macroeconomic recovery efforts.\n\nAt the Economic Governance Platform(EGP), we view this decision as a clear signal of improving economic conditions and growing confidence in the country’s stabilization programme.\n\nA Journey from Tight Control to Strategic Easing\nThis outcome did not emerge overnight.Over the past year, Ghana’s monetary policy stance moved through phases of restraint, discipline, and cautious adjustment.The policy rate peaked at 28 % earlier in 2025 when inflation remained persistent.Rather than relax prematurely, the Bank maintained a tight stance until firm disinflation indicators emerged.Only then did it begin easing — first in July, then again in September and October — culminating in this most recent and bold adjustment.\n\nFrom the peak of 28 %, Ghana has now recorded a cumulative policy easing of 1,000 basis points, reflecting a carefully staged transition from inflation containment to economic stimulus.\n\nWhy the Bank Acted Now\nSeveral macroeconomic developments shaped this decision:\n• Inflation has fallen sharply — from over 23 % in January 2025 to 8 % in October, placing it squarely within the Bank’s medium - term target band for the first time since 2021.\n• The cedi has stabilised strongly, supported by improved foreign reserves, a surplus current account, and renewed market confidence.\n• Fiscal consolidation has taken hold, with Ghana recording a primary surplus and outperforming deficit targets in the first nine months of 2025.\n• Economic activity is rebounding, with business confidence, consumption, and production all showing sustained improvement.\n\n            Together, these factors provided the policy space for easing without undermining price stability.\n\nWhat This Means for Businesses, Investors, and Households\nThe cut is expected to generate wide - ranging effects across the economy:\n• Cheaper credit: Lending to the private sector is expected to pick up, especially for manufacturing, SMEs, and agribusiness.\n• Lower government borrowing costs: Falling interest rates will ease pressure on the budget and free fiscal space for development spending.\n• Treasury bill yields are likely to decline further, improving market liquidity.\n• Improved investor sentiment: The combination of falling inflation and a stable exchange rate strengthens Ghana’s attractiveness to both domestic and international investors.\n\nWhile market interest rates may not fall immediately to match the policy rate, EGP anticipates more favourable financing conditions within the next two quarters.\n\nRisks That Still Require Vigilance\nDespite the positive outlook, risks remain:\n• Global commodity price shocks could reintroduce inflationary pressures.\n• Capital outflows are possible as Ghana’s rate advantage narrows.\n• Domestic demand growth could become excessive if not properly managed.\n\nThe Bank’s return to active liquidity management through short - term instruments will be critical to navigating this transition.\n\n            EGP’s View\nEGP believes the 350bps cut is a bold but justified decision.It reflects discipline, consistency, and confidence rooted in evidence, not sentiment.The current real interest rate remains positive, meaning inflation control is still intact even as growth is supported.\n\n            However, sustaining these gains requires continued fiscal discipline, financial sector reform, and careful monitoring of macroeconomic risks.\n\nThe Way Forward\nFor businesses, this is the moment to plan investments strategically and negotiate financing more actively.\nFor policymakers, the task is to preserve hard - won stability through responsible fiscal management.\nFor investors, Ghana’s improving fundamentals present opportunity — but discipline must be maintained on all fronts.",

      "content": "A coalition of Ghanaian Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), including the Economic Governance Platform (EGP), held a farewell meeting with the outgoing Resident Representative of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to Ghana. The meeting served as an opportunity to reflect on the IMF’s engagement with civil society during a turbulent period in Ghana’s economic history.\n\nThe CSOs acknowledged the Resident Representative’s openness to dialogue and willingness to engage with non - state actors, a departure from the more opaque relationships of the past.They highlighted how regular briefings and access to data had empowered CSOs to monitor the IMF programme more effectively and hold the government accountable.\n\n            However, the groups also raised lingering concerns.They pointed to the social impact of the rigorous fiscal adjustments required by the programme and urged the IMF to place a stronger emphasis on social impact assessments in future reviews.EGP specifically raised the issue of debt transparency and the need for the Fund to be more vocal about the governance reforms that are structural benchmarks of the programme.\n\n<img src=\"/assets/images/publications/imf-boss-farewell-2.jpg\" alt=\"Farewell Meeting\" className=\"w-full h-auto rounded-xl my-6 shadow-md\" />\n\nIn response, the outgoing Resident Representative thanked the CSOs for their constructive criticism and partnership.He emphasized that the IMF views civil society as a critical partner in ensuring programme ownership and sustainability.He urged the CSOs to maintain their vigilance and continue to demand accountability from national leaders.\n\nAs Ghana continues its journey under the Extended Credit Facility, the relationship between the IMF and renewed civil society will remain a critical accountability mechanism.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"/assets/images/publications/imf-boss-farewell.jpg\" alt=\"Group Photo\" className=\"w-full h-auto rounded-xl my-6 shadow-md\" />",

      "excerpt": "Fitch Solutions forecasts further easing of Ghana's policy rate to 16.5% by 2026, contingent on sustained disinflation.",
      "content": "Fitch Solutions has projected that Ghana’s Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) could decline to 16.5% by 2026, signalling expectations of easing inflation pressures and a gradually stabilising macroeconomic environment. This projection comes at a critical moment, as the Bank of Ghana’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets this week to set the next policy rate.\n\nA potential downward trajectory in the policy rate reflects improving inflation dynamics, strengthened fiscal consolidation under the IMF - supported programme, and a recovering cedi.However, the path to lower interest rates will depend heavily on sustained policy credibility, revenue performance, and disciplined expenditure management.\n\nFor businesses and households, a future easing in the policy rate would mean lower borrowing costs, improved access to credit, and reduced pressure on the private sector.But Ghana is not there yet.Inflation, though declining, remains above target; global conditions are still uncertain; and domestic revenue mobilisation remains fragile.\n\nAs the MPC prepares its decision this week, EGP will be monitoring three key areas:\n        1. Inflation Trends: Is the disinflation path durable enough to support aggressive cuts ?\n            2. Currency Stability: Can the cedi withstand lower interest rates without triggering capital flight ?\n                3. Fiscal Discipline: Will government spending in the coming months align with tight monetary policy ?\n\n                    Fitch’s projection offers a glimpse of hope for a cheaper cost of credit in the medium term.But for now, all eyes are on the Bank of Ghana’s decision and the data that drives it.",

      "content": "The Economic Governance Platform (EGP) joined other Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) at the Annual CSO Budget Forum to review and analyze the 2026 National Budget Statement and Economic Policy. The forum, organized by the Civil Society Platform on the IMF Programme, provided a critical space for non-state actors to interrogate the government’s revenue and expenditure plans for the coming fiscal year.\n\nDuring the session, EGP’s research team highlighted key concerns regarding the credibility of revenue projections and the allocation of resources to social protection programmes.While acknowledging the government's commitment to fiscal consolidation under the IMF programme, CSOs raised questions about the realism of the 2026 domestic revenue targets, given the underperformance in previous years.\n\nKey takeaways from the forum included:\n• The need for more aggressive expenditure rationalization to complement revenue measures.\n• Concerns over the rising cost of debt service, which continues to crowd out discretionary spending.\n• A call for greater transparency in the utilization of the Annual Budget Funding Amount(ABFA) from oil revenues.\n• The importance of ring - fencing social spending to protect the most vulnerable from the impact of austerity measures.\n\nThe forum concluded with a communiqué urging Parliament to scrutinize the budget estimates rigorously before approval.EGP remains committed to providing evidence - based analysis to support this process and ensure that the 2026 budget delivers on its promise of stability and growth.",

      "excerpt": "EGP's analysis of the 2026 Budget: A balance between fiscal consolidation and the need for social protection.",
      "content": "The 2026 Budget Statement, presented under the theme 'Consolidating Stability for Shared Growth,' reflects a government attempting to balance the books while stimulating an economy still recovering from deep scars. At the Economic Governance Platform (EGP), our preliminary analysis suggests a budget that is directionally correct but operationally ambitious.\n\nKey Highlights & EGP Observations:\n\n1. Revenue Measures: The reliance on widening the tax net rather than introducing new taxes is a welcome shift. The digitalization of property rates and the streamline of VAT invoicing are long-overdue reforms. However, EGP cautions that administrative efficiency takes time to yield results. If these measures underperform, the government may be forced to cut expenditure or borrow more — neither of which is desirable.\n\n2. Expenditure Control: The budget proposes a decline in the deficit to 3.5% of GDP. This signal of fiscal discipline is crucial for investor confidence. Yet, the wage bill and interest payments continue to consume over 60% of domestic revenue. EGP advocates for a more aggressive rationalization of non-essential recurrent expenditure to free up fiscal space.\n\n3. Social Protection: We note the increased allocation to LEAP and the School Feeding Programme. In a time of rising cost of living, protecting the vulnerable is non-negotiable. EGP will be monitoring the timely release of these funds, as allocation does not always equal disbursement.\n\n4. Debt Sustainability: The budget hinges on the successful completion of external debt restructuring. EGP urges the government to be transparent about the terms of these agreements and their long-term implications for Ghana’s creditworthiness.\n\nConclusion:\nThe 2026 Budget offers a pathway to stability, but it is paved with implementation risks. EGP calls on Parliament to exercise rigorous oversight and on citizens to demand value for every cedi spent. We are not out of the woods yet, but with discipline and vigilance, recovery is within reach.",

      "excerpt": "The stalled Bolgatanga-Bawku road project stands as a grim symbol of the real-world impact of Ghana's debt crisis.",
      "content": "The Bolgatanga-Bawku-Polimakom road is more than just a stretch of asphalt; it is a major economic artery connecting the Upper East Region to the borders of Burkina Faso and Togo. For years, residents and travelers endured a perilous journey on this dusty, pothole-riddled road. In 2016, hope was ignited when the government awarded a contract for its reconstruction. Work began, and for a while, the dust seemed to settle.\n\nHowever, in 2022, the machinery fell silent. The contractor demobilized, leaving the road in a state worse than before. The reason? Ghana’s escalating debt crisis. As the government struggled to service its mounting debts, payments to contractors nationwide stalled. The Bolgatanga-Bawku road became a casualty of fiscal distress.\n\nThe Human Cost of a Stalled Project\nFor the people of Bawku and surrounding communities, the halted construction was not just a bureaucratic delay; it was a daily hazard. The exposed sharp edges of culverts, deep trenches left uncovered, and excessive dust pollution turned the road into a death trap.\n\n“We see accidents here every week,” says generic resident name, a trader who plies the route daily. “The dust gives us respiratory problems, and when it rains, the road becomes a river. We were promised development, but we got injuries.”\n\nHealth officials in the district reported a spike in upper respiratory tract infections, directly linked to the dust pollution. Meanwhile, the cost of transportation soared as vehicle owners passed on the higher maintenance costs to commuters.\n\nA Glimmer of Hope?\nWith the recent disbursement of IMF funds and the restructuring of debt, the government has signaled a resumption of work on priority infrastructure projects. Contractors are slowly returning to site. But for the victims of accidents on the abandoned road, the relief comes too late.\n\nThis story serves as a stark reminder: macroeconomic statistics and debt figures on a spreadsheet have real, painful consequences on the ground. As Ghana navigates its recovery, the completion of projects like the Bolgatanga-Bawku road must be prioritized, not just for economic connectivity, but for the safety and dignity of its citizens.",

      "slug": "sustainable-debt-management-ghana",
      "excerpt": "A deep dive into Ghana's debt history, the recent crisis, and the path toward sustainable borrowing.",
      "content": "Ghana has been an active participant in the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, benefiting from substantial debt relief in the early 2000s. This relief created fiscal space that allowed for significant investments in infrastructure and social services, contributing to a period of robust economic growth. However, in recent years, the country’s debt trajectory has once again become a source of major concern for policymakers, international partners, and civil society.\n\nPost-HIPC Borrowing and the Rise of Commercial Debt\nFollowing its exit from HIPC, Ghana gained access to international capital markets, issuing its first Eurobond in 2007. This marked a shift in the debt portfolio from primarily concessional loans (from institutions like the World Bank and bilateral partners) to more expensive commercial debt. While this unlocked capital for development projects, it also exposed the economy to exchange rate volatility and higher debt servicing costs. By 2022, debt service was consuming more than half of government revenue, crowding out critical spending on health, education, and social protection.\n\nThe Current Crisis and the DDEP\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and global geopolitical shocks exacerbated Ghana’s fiscal vulnerabilities, pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio above 90% by 2022. This necessitated a return to the IMF and the launch of a Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP) in 2023 — a painful but necessary step to restore debt sustainability. The DDEP imposed significant losses on bondholders, including pension funds and individual investors, highlighting the real-world cost of unsustainable borrowing.\n\nThe Way Forward: Transparency and Accountability\nSustainable debt management requires more than just restructuring; it demands a fundamental change in how debt is contracted and utilized. EGP advocates for:\n• Greater Parliamentary Oversight: Parliament must rigorously scrutinize loan agreements to ensure they offer value for money.\n• Enhanced Transparency: All debt obligations, including collateralized loans and off-balance-sheet liabilities, must be publicly disclosed.\n• Strict Adherence to the Fiscal Responsibility Act: The deficit cap of 5% of GDP must be respected to prevent future spirals.\n\nGhana’s path to recovery lies not in borrowing more, but in borrowing wisely and spending efficiently. Only through prudent management can we ensure that future generations do not inherit a burden they did not create.",
